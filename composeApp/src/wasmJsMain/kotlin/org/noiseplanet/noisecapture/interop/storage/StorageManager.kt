     *
     * `quota`: A numeric value in bytes which provides a conservative approximation of the total
     *  storage the user's device or computer has available for the site origin or Web app.
     *  It's possible that there's more than this amount of space available though you can't rely
     *  on that being the case.
     *
     * `usage`: A numeric value in bytes approximating the amount of storage space currently being used
     *  by the site or Web app, out of the available space as indicated by quota. Unit is byte.
     *
     * `usageDetails`: An object containing a breakdown of usage by storage system.
     *  All included properties will have a usage greater than 0 and any storage system with 0 usage
     *  will be excluded from the object.
     *
     * > Note: The returned values are not exact: between compression, deduplication, and obfuscation for security reasons, they will be imprecise.
     *
     * You may find that the quota varies from origin to origin. This variance is based on factors such as:
     *
     * - How often the user visits
     * - Public site popularity data
     * - User engagement signals like bookmarking, adding to homescreen, or accepting push notifications
