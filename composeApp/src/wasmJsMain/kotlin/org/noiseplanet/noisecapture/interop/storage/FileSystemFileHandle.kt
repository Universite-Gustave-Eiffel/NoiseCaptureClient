 * `"readwrite"` Only one FileSystemSyncAccessHandle object can be opened on a file.
 *               Attempting to open subsequent handles before the first handle is closed results in
 *               a NoModificationAllowedError exception being thrown. Once opened, any available

 *                      on a file, provided they are all opened in "readwrite-unsafe" mode. Once
