# About NoiseCapture App

![Build status](https://github.com/nicolas-f/NoiseCaptureKotlin/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)

**NoiseCapture App** is Android App dedicated to the measurement of environmental noise.

## Description
**NoiseCapture App** is an Android App project for measuring environmental noise using a smartphone. The goal is to **produce relevant noise indicators from audio measurements, including a geospatial representation**. Measurements can be shared with the community in order to produce participatory noise maps. **NoiseCapture App** is a component of a global infrastructure, _i.e._ a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI), called the **OnoMap SDI**, that allows to process and represent the geospatial information, like noise maps.

* A  [**full description**](https://github.com/Ifsttar/NoiseCapture/wiki) of the whole OnoMap SDI, including the NoiseCapture App, is given in the [wiki pages](https://github.com/Ifsttar/NoiseCapture/wiki).
* An **user guide**, for the use of the NoiseCapture App, is proposed within the NoiseCapture App (see the 'Help' page in the menu of NoiseCapture App).

## Features

NoiseCapture App features are divided into 3 parts:

 - Measurement - Once the sound level calibration is done, the user start the measurement in order to record each second the LAeq, an average sound energy over a period of 1s. The spectrum repartition of the sound are analysed and stored using the Fourrier transform. The device location are recorded while measuring the sound level. The user has the hability to provide his own feedback about the feeling of the noise environment.

 - Extented report - Advanced statistics are computed locally on the phone and shown to the user. For each user's measurement the locations of the noise levels are displayed in a map.

 - Share results with the community - Anonymous results are transfered to Virtual Hubs (web server) and post-processed in order to build a noise map that merge all community results. Participative noise maps can be displayed within the NoiseCapture App, or online at https://onomap.noise-planet.org/.

## Developments
NoiseCapture App is a collaboration between the [Environmental Acoustic Research unit](http://www.umrae.fr/en/) ([Ifsttar](http://www.ifsttar.fr)) and the [Lab-STICC](http://www.lab-sticc.fr/) CNRS. If you need more information about the project developped by the Environmental Acoustic Research unit and the Lab-STICC, on this topic, go to [http://www.noise-planet.org](http://noise-planet.org).
