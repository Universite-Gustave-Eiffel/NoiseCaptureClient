# Appyx starter kit

This repository contains a baseline Compose Multiplatform project with minimal setup to bootstrap starting an Appyx app from scratch. All the available platforms are already configured for you: Android, iOS, Desktop and Web.

Please refer to JetBrains documentation [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/) for more details about each one of the supported platform.  

If you're looking for a Android-specific setup, please check out `main` branch [here](https://github.com/bumble-tech/appyx-starter-kit).

Feel free to download it and modify it to your needs.
