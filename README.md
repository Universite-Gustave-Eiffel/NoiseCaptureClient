**NoiseCapture** is an Android/Ios/Web App dedicated to the measurement of environmental noise.

## Description
**NoiseCapture** is an Android/Ios/Web App for measuring environmental noise using a smartphone/tablet device.
The goal is to **produce relevant noise indicators from audio measurements, including a geospatial representation**. Measurements can be shared with the community in order to produce participatory noise maps. **NoiseCapture App** is a component of a global infrastructure, _i.e._ a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI), called the **OnoMap SDI**, that allows to process and represent the geospatial information, like noise maps.

## Funding
This application was developed under the initial funding the European project [ENERGIC-OD](http://www.energic-od.eu/), with the help of the [GEOPAL](http://www.geopal.org/accueil) program.
